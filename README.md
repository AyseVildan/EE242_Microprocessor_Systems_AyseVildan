Term Project IoT Colorful LED Strip Flames

What is the goal?

This project is an implementation of the Arduino project “Play with Fire Over Wi-Fi ”
to the STM32F4 Discovery board. The original project aims to make a lamp that has a 
flame-effect and can be controlled by a phone application over wifi. My approach will 
be to create the project with the STM32f4 discovery board instead of Arduino using the
same idea and same materials.

•	STM32F4 Discovery board,  WS2812B RGB addressable led strip,	ESP8266  Wifi module are used

According to goals LED stript is worked. (Own library is created)
Unfortunatelly Wifi modul did not worked and it could not be replaced because of the pandemic conditions
