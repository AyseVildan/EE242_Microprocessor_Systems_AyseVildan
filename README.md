Term Project IoT Colorful LED Strip Flames

What is the goal?

	This project is an implementation of the Arduino project “Play with Fire Over Wi-Fi ”
to the STM32F4 Discovery board. The original project aims to make a lamp that has a 
flame-effect and can be controlled by a phone application over wifi. My approach will 
be to create the project with the STM32f4 discovery board instead of Arduino using the
same idea and same materials.
